Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity dawg
Might consider Venus as a base
I'd really like to visit Mars
Has a lot of Iron Oxide deposits so could be rusty
Some people think they can blow that some nukes up to make it more habitable 
It's very cold so I'm changing section 1.
