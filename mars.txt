Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity dawg
Might consider Venus as a base
Has a lot of Iron Oxide deposits so could be rusty
Some people think they can blow that some nukes up to make it more habitable
